  "description": "This is my portfolio that I used making React. I really like using React especially with the single page application. It gives such an a great user experience with page navigation. Reading up online was tricky with the newer updates to react and it seems like the community hasnâ€™t caught up to the new syntax. I particularly like the new component form of coding that the newer for of React allows. I used it to create my blog posts and for my projects sections as they are broken down into smaller pieces.",
