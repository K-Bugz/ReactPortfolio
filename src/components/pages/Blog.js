  des: 'have done a few simple SPA projects using React and I love it. I really enjoy how reactive it is. Every "page" seems so effortlessly generated. I also enjoy the component programming. Learning the use effect and state was difficult at first and will continue to practice this. I also learned that you need an effect for each variable your want to manipulate.',
