      <h1>Welcome to Kevin Bugusky's Portfolio!</h1>
      <p>
      Originally from Illinois, I have made a new home here in Austin Texas. I enjoy coding, learning,
      chess, mathematics, computers, movies, coffee, pens, music, and sports. <br></br><br></br>
      I have spent the last decade teaching mathematics and computer science. Molding young minds is a
      rewarding job that has given me memories and friendships forever. Now, I am pursuing my
      dreams and going into coding full-time! I particular am intersted in fullstack developing in JS 
      or Python. I have now completed a fullstack bootcamp through UT! I am excited to apply my new skils.
